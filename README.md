# Image-Classification-with-K-Fold-Cross-Validation-and-Performance-Metrics

The dataset we used in this project has been collected from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ritesh2000/car-brand-images-dataset
The dataset comprises images of three car types, organized into three subfolders: 'audi', 'lamborghini' and 'mercedes'. 
Through accurate image classification of each car, we aim to enhance our understanding of their visual characteristics and improve the ability to distinguish between them in future applications.
